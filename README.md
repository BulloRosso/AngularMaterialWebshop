# AngularMaterialEventApp
A demo single page application using angular 1.4 and material design for angular 0.10 hosted in an ASP.NET MVC 4/WebAPI project.

<h2>What is this all about?</h2>

<p>This tech demo shows how to build a real world SPA using <strong>Google's Material Design</strong> instead of the predominant Bootstrap 3 framework.</p>
