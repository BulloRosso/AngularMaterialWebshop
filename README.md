# AngularMaterialWebshop
A demo single page application using angular 1.4 and material design for angular 0.10 hosted in an ASP.NET MVC 4/WebAPI project.

<h2>What is this all about?</h2>

<p>This is a proof of concept for an application using <strong>Google's Material Design</strong> instead of the predominant Bootstrap 3 framework.</p>

<p>Attention: This is not a ready-to-go template or starter-kit!</p>

<p>
If you know how to use Bootstrap there are few questions you might face relatively early:
<ul>
<li>How does the grid system work?</li>
<li>How do I use the offcanvas pattern?</li>
<li>How does a minimal navigation structure work?</li>
<li>What kind of animations can I use?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Hopefully, this demo will answer the questions above along with some other issues you might encounter on your way to your first material design app...
</p>

<h2>Example use case: Webshop</h2>

<p>
<strong>Tiles</strong> inside the grid represent the available courses and illustrate one problem with minimalistic design: stakeholders will try to squeeze in as many information as they can. In the demo the place is completely taken by:
<ul>
<li>Course title</li>
<li>Course date (upper right corner)</li>
<li>Booking status indicator (upper left corner)</li>
</ul>
As a suggestion to keep the design "clear" the course date is only shown if the user set one of the filters under the section "Date Range":

<p>The detail page features a tab pane:</p>

<p>Registering as a new user reveals an interesting new approach to web forms:</p>
