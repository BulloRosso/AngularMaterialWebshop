# AngularMaterialWebshop
A demo application using angular 1.4 and material design for angular 0.10 hosted in an ASP.NET MVC 5/WebAPI project.

<h2>What is this all about?</h2>

<p>This is a proof of concept for an application using <strong>Google's Material Design</strong> instead of the predominant Bootstrap 3 framework.</p>

<p>Attention: This is not a ready-to-go template or starter-kit!</p>

<p>Attention: This is not a single page application! AngularJS is just used to extend single pages - the heavylifting is done by ASP.NET MVC views and controllers.

<p>
If you know how to use Bootstrap there are few questions you might face relatively early:
<ul>
<li>How does the grid system work?</li>
<li>How do I use the offcanvas pattern?</li>
<li>How does a minimal navigation structure work?</li>
<li>What kind of animations can I use?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Hopefully, this demo will answer the questions above along with some other issues you might encounter on your way to your first material design app...
</p>

<h2>Example use case: Webshop</h2>

<strong>Tiles</strong> inside a flex grid on the welcome page are meant to test the versatility of the grid component. Currently 4 types of tiles are showcased:
<ul>
<li>Image tile</li>
<li>Image tile with con in the header</li>
<li>Image tile with call-to-action button</li>
<li>Text tile</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>shopping cart</strong> showcases some animations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Slide in for the offcanvas menu</li>
<li>Slide out for deleted cart items</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>communication menu</strong> illustrates the use of subnavigation (tabs) inside the offcanvas element:</p>
